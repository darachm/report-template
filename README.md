This is a template for how to report thinking and results with others.

The first attempt was using pure pandoc markdown, but upon consideration and
first contact with the practice I think I need to just go ahead and keep
report writing and presentations separate.

Presentations
  ~ Use reveal.js in a private browser. I need to up my graphics games. 
    Animated SVG would be pretty cool, but I could just go to d3 all the way,
    especially if I can figure out flow charts.
   
Reports
  ~ Use markdown typeset to HTML and PDF.
    The pandoc graphviz filter is from [github.com/Hakuyume/pandoc-filter-graphviz](github.com/Hakuyume/pandoc-filter-graphviz)
