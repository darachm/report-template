This is a template for how to report thinking and results with others.

The first attempt was using pure pandoc markdown, but upon consideration and
first contact with the practice I think I need to just go ahead and keep
report writing and presentations separate.

Presentations
  ~ Use reveal.js in a private browser. I need to up my graphics games, and 
    animated SVG would be pretty cool.
    Use a javascript plugin for graphviz to images.
    Maybe have a script to yank all graphics and style sheets into a monolithic
    HTML file, base64 etc.
   
Reports
  ~ Use markdown typeset to HTML and PDF.
    The pandoc graphviz filter is from [github.com/Hakuyume/pandoc-filter-graphviz](github.com/Hakuyume/pandoc-filter-graphviz)
