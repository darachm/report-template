This is testing and making a template for presentations using a more modern 
setup. I'm thinking using reveal.js with markdown and PDF exports, so needs a
Makefile and those files.

Also need to up my graphics games, and animated SVG would be pretty trick.
Need to ironclad a browser to display, maybe profiles would be good.
