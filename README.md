This is a template for how to report thinking and results with others.
It's a template of a reveal.js presentation at `prezi.html`, as well as a 
`report.md` file that should be the written report for papers and the like.

For presentations, 
need to up my graphics games, and animated SVG would be pretty trick.
Need to ironclad a browser to display, maybe profiles would be good.
